                    For the last 2 years, I've been on a mission to make a bronze casting of my sculpture using the lost wax method. I've built an incredible community of local art supporters on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

                <p>
                    Im overwhelmed with the level of engagement and interest I've experienced with this community. It is unexpected, and extremely appreciated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'd like to try something I haven't done before, and offer everyone a way to be a part of bringing my art to life.
